# Microsoft Excel Data Analysis and Dashboard Reporting Project

This project showcases my ability to utilize Microsoft Excel for comprehensive data analysis and interactive dashboard creation. Below is a detailed overview of the project:

## Objective
To analyze a large dataset, clean and summarize the data, and present it in an interactive and user-friendly dashboard using Microsoft Excel.

## Key Features
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Imported raw data and formatted it as tables for better organization.
   - Applied functions like `IF`, `TEXT`, and `CHOOSE` to clean and manipulate the data.

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Utilized advanced filtering and `PivotTables` to analyze and summarize the data.
   - Employed `VLOOKUP` and `INDEX/MATCH` functions for efficient data lookup.

3. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - Designed a dynamic dashboard using `PivotTables`, `PivotCharts`, and slicers.
   - Created drop-down menus with Data Validation to allow users to select different criteria.
   - Implemented VBA macros to automate repetitive tasks and enhance dashboard interactivity.

4. **Data Presentation and Protection**
   - Cleaned up default settings and hid unnecessary worksheets and columns.
   - Protected the dashboard to maintain its integrity and prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Tools and Techniques
- **VLOOKUP**: For looking up information from the data table.
- **INDEX/MATCH**: As a powerful alternative to VLOOKUP for more flexible data retrieval.
- **TEXT Functions**: For formatting data and extracting date values.
- **Advanced Filtering**: To streamline data analysis and extraction.
- **PivotTables and PivotCharts**: For summarizing and visualizing data.
- **VBA Macros**: For automating tasks and creating dynamic content.
- **Slicers and Drop-Down Menus**: For user-friendly navigation and data filtering.

## Outcome
This project resulted in the creation of an interactive Excel dashboard that effectively summarizes and presents data. It demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis, advanced Excel functions, and dashboard creation. The project highlights my ability to handle complex data sets, automate tasks, and present insights in a visually appealing and interactive manner.

## Files Included
- `CustomerOrders-Final Project.xlsm`: The main Excel file containing the data, analysis, and interactive dashboard.

## How to Use
1. **Open the Excel File**: Download and open the `CustomerOrders-Final Project.xlsm` file.
2. **Enable Macros**: Ensure that macros are enabled to utilize the interactive features.
3. **Interact with the Dashboard**: Use the drop-down menus, slicers, and interactive charts to explore the data.

This project is an excellent demonstration of my skills in Microsoft Excel, data analysis, and dashboard reporting. It serves as a valuable addition to my portfolio, showcasing my ability to deliver insightful and dynamic data presentations.
